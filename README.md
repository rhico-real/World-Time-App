My first app created by Flutter!

I used world time api to update the world time in real time.

Steps to view this app:
1. Clone this repo or download by Zip.
2. Open Android Studio.
3. Open the file depending on where you have saved the Zip file/cloned the repo.
4. Start the AVD or plug in your Android phone to your laptop/pc using a USB (note: On your phone, you must enable USB debugger first in the Developer Options).
5. Run the program!
